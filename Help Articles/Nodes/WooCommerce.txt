When turned ON - Any empty custom properties on the node that would usually be expressed as query string paremeters are ignored.

 


AuthenticateUsingQueryStringParameters
Type: Boolean
When turned ON - Authentication is passed inside the URL via query string parameters, turn this ON when the WooCommerce site won't accept authentication via headers.


OperationId
Type: String Input

Mandatory (Auto-generated when a sample is selected)
Contains the ID of the operation chosen from a Node Sample. This property shouldn't be manually changed.

 

Description
Type: String Input
A generated description of the operation based on what was available in the Swagger document.




Request
Type: Multiline Text Input
Contains the request payload (usually JSON) that provides the detail of the operation to perform. A sample value for this property is populated when a Node Sample is selected.



ResponseCode
Type: Type: String Output
Contains the response code returned from the API Server. 200 = Success etc.



Response
Type: Multiline Text Output
Contains the response payload (usually JSON) as received from the API. Where possible, a sample value of this property is populated when a Node Sample is selected.



Custom Inputs
This Node supports Custom Input Properties and the appropriate properties will be added to the Node when a Node Sample is selected. These Properties are resolved into parameters in the URL that is generated for the request. For example, if the operation will query a customer record, the Swagger document may specify the URL template as /customers/{customerId} . In this case, a Custom Property called customerId will be added to the Node when a "get customer" Node Sample is selected.


 

Remarks
HTTPS Required
The WooCommerce Node makes use of Consumer Key & Secret -based authorization. For this reason, only HTTPS URL's are supported. Ensure that the value provided in WooCommerceBaseUrl begins with https://  and not http:// .

 

Using Samples
This Node provides Samples for all supported calls. Samples can be accessed from the Node Samples Pane.

 

Authentication Errors
Depending on the way your website is configured, it may not accept the default authentication model where key & secret are passed via the HTTPS Authorization Header. If you receive a key or secret error, turn on the AuthenticateUsingQueryStringParameters Property in the Connection.
